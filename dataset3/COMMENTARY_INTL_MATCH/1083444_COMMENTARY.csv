Mendis gets down to sweep but the ball straightens after pitching and it is anyway not full enough to sweep. The question is if he has got a glove to it as he misses with the sweep and the ball goes to the wicketkeeper. Not an easy call for the third umpire. Seems like the ball has snuck from beneath the under edge but it really is touch and go.
