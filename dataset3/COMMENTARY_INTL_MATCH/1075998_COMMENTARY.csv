out,953835,Karachi Kings,953833,Peshawar Zalmi,1st innings,0,"oh, that's a super catch by Eoin Morgan at long-on. Made it look so simple but he had to do some work there. Gayle comes down the track and tries to clear long-on. Morgan takes it revese-cupped, had to push back slightly to get behind that and he plants the foot just in front of the boundary cushion. The momentum takes him further back, so he throws the ball up, crosses the rope, gets back in front of it and completes the catch. They go upstairs to check if the foot has touched the rope when he first takes the catch. But I think the issue is when he catches the ball a second time.
