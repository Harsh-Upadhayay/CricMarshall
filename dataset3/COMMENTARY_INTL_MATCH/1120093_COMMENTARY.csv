The reason the two on-field umpires wanted a second opinion was because they wanted to check on the bump ball. But instead, Anil Chaudhary comes back with, 'bat hit the ground' and rules not out. That prompts New Zealand <b>to review</b> and the same man who ruled this not out has to change his decision because Ultra-Edge shows a spike as ball passes bat.","Boult to Sharma, OUT",185/3,277912,Trent Boult,0,24,1,4.0,49,55395,Colin de Grandhomme,0,18,0,3.0,34,34102,Rohit Sharma,80,55,6,4,253802,Virat Kohli,16,7,0,2,6,True,0,0,0,0,0,19,11,1,True,caught,False,RG Sharma c &dagger;Latham b Boult 80 (85m 55b 6x4 4x6) SR: 145.45,9.73,0,114,0,3,0,1,1,0,185
