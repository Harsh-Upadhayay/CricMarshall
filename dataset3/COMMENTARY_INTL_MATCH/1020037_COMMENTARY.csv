Everything he tries is working in his favour. This was too full and Guptill could not get right on top of it. Lofts it and gets good elevation but not the distance. Du Plessis runs across to his right from long-off and dives but the ball drops short","Parnell to Guptill, 1 run",0,265564,Wayne Parnell,1,42,0,7.0,44,40618,Imran Tahir,2,54,2,9.0,38,226492,Martin Guptill,163,133,15,9,7502,Luke Ronchi,0,0,0,0,6,True,0,0,0,0,0,44,5,0,False,,False,False,5.95,0,264,0,3,0,1,1,0,262

Tries to pull this short of good length ball but Tahir gets it to spin a good distance outside off and Guptill drags it to long-off. Brilliant fielding by the fielder and the throw is fired to Tahir who collects it but dislodges the bails with his hands as he throws the ball. Guptill was on the line when the bails came off and he would have been gone,"Imran Tahir to Guptill, 1 run",0,40618,Imran Tahir,2,56,2,9.2,41,265564,Wayne Parnell,1,42,0,7.0,44,226492,Martin Guptill,166,135,15,9,7502,Luke Ronchi,0,0,0,0,2,False,0,0,0,0,0,45,18,0,False,,False,False,5.97,0,266,0,3,0,1,1,0,265
