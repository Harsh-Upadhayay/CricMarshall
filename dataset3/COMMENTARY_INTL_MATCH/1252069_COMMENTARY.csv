out,8,Sri Lanka,4,West Indies,1st innings,0,"was that a run out chance? Pollard's not happy about this. Possible obstruction of the field here against Gunathilaka.

Ok, so here's what happens. It's a length ball that Gunathilaka plays at and it drops right by his feet. But Pathum Nissanka is charging through for the single and is three quarters of the way down the pitch and Danushka turns him back. But in his efforts to get back to the crease himself, Danushka back-heels the ball, and this is the problem. Pollard has seen that there's a run out chance here and gone haring after the ball. Gunathilaka kicking it prevents him from picking it up. Umpire Joel Wilson refers this to the third ump. who very quickly rules that this is an obstruction of the field offence and gives Gunathilaka out.
