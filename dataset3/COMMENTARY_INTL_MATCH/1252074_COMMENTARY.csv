He played way away from his body and the sound couldn't have been anything but bat. Replays look like he played through the shot too early and the ball rolled off the back of the bat blade to Da Silva. Ultraedge is showing no spike and a gap when he plays the shot initially on the front of the bat face but a spike appears when the ball passes the back of the bat blade on the bowed portion. The third umpire is having some doubt because Dhananjaya's body is obscuring the bat from the side-on replay angle on the point/off side.
