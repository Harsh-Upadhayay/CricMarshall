Roy has shuffled across to work this towards fine leg with soft hands. Bumrah swoops in from fine leg, surprises Hales with a throw at the non-striker's end, and Hales doesn't even dive. This is slightly dopey from Hales. First he is not expecting the throw at his end, and then he doesn't put in a dive. We do have a bit of a situation here, though. The umpire and Kohli have blocked the cameras from either end, and the third umpire can't see the bails. He makes the decision relying on the illuminating of the LED stumps.
