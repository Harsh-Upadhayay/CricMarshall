out,4,West Indies,7,Pakistan,4th innings,0,"big appeal for a catch at short leg, and Oxenford's finger goes up immediately. Dowrich reviews immediately. Tossed up outside leg, and Dowrich is only half-forward as he tries to flick against the turn. Loops up off the pad to the short-leg fielder. Was there any bat on it? The toe of Dowrich's bat hit the ground for sure. From replays, the ball seems to pass the inside edge without really grazing it, but is there conclusive evidence? Difficult decision, this. Personally, I don't think he edged it. But the third umpire is reviewing Bruce Oxenford's decision, which was out. From side-by-side front-on and side-on images, it seems that there's a bit of gap between bat and ball when it passes the edge. But you can't be entirely sure. The third umpire stays with the on-field decision.
