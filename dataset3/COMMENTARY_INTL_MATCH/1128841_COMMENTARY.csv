<b>McCullum and Lahore want clarification</b>. He's talking to the umpire, presumably about the run off the previous delivery. The commentators say that 'McCullum thought that they needed one off the final ball.' There's still a lot of confusion, but sanity prevails eventually. It'll be a super over.
