He collects the ball, falls in front of the stumps, and under-arms it into the stumps to catch Hazlewood short. Hazlewood had lost his head. He was off for a single - there wasn't a single there - he has to spin back. He dishes out a desperate dive, but that's not enough. <b>This is the first time Hazlewood has been dismissed in an ODI</b>. Spare a thought for Marcus Stonis, though.
