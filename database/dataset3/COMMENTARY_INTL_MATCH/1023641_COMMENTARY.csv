Bresnan now hangs onto the chest-high chance. Was Turner's foot in contact with the rope while he was collecting the ball? The replays aren't conclusive enough, I suppose. Quite difficult to judge from this. Bailey waits; he isn't going anywhere. But, Mealey, the TV umpire, rules Bailey out. Excellent awareness from the two fielders, nevertheless.
