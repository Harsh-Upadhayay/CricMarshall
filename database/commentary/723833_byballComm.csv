0.0,"Start of Tasmania Innings. Good morning from the WACA Ground where Western Australia are taking on Tasmania in the Marsh Sheffield Shield. It's a return fixture from just a week ago where WA had a massive 383 run win in Hobart, and another performance like that would secure them Shield Final hosting rights for the second year running. It's a warm and slightly overcast morning here in Perth, with warm sunny conditions expected for the remainder of the match. Despite a green looking pitch, Jordan Silk won the toss for Tasmania and has elected to bat first. Stay tuned for the start of play at 10:30am WST.",,
