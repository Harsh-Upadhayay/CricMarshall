0.0,"Start of New South Wales Innings. A beautiful day greets the players in Albury in the match between NSW and Victoria. The teams come into the penultimate round having had contrasting seasons. The young Victorian team have exceeded expectations and are in a good position to secure a place in the final, currently sitting second. Meanwhile, NSW have had a poor season. They have two matches left to avoid the ignominy of a winless campaign.",,
