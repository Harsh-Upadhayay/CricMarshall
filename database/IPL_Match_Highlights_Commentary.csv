4281444,RCB 1st Inns,0.5,"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, first boundary for Mandeep and RCB. Full and on the pads, needed to be put away and Mandeep did just that, picked it up and dispatched it over mid-wicket, couple of bounces and into the fence",Nehra to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,1.0,"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, back-to-back boundaries to end the first over. Again, Nehra is a tad short in his length, Mandeep had the width to cut and he didn't try to hit it hard, just placed it behind point and Bhuvi at third man gave up the chase pretty quickly",Nehra to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,10.0,"Henriques to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, hit straight back at Henriques and he was late to get his hand up. Once more the off-cutter which almost fooled Jadhav, who shimmied down and checked his drive, middled it alright to beat the mid-off fielder",Henriques to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,10.4,"Nehra to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, another full toss, it's Jadhav this time and he picks his spot into the deep mid-wicket fence. Not great bowling from Nehra. He's missing the yorker by quite a bit",Nehra to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,10.5,"Nehra to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, four more. Jadhav starting to really find his timing now and he's looking dangerous. This is smart batting rather than just throwing his bat at everything. He knows that fine leg is up and so he waits for the back of a length delivery to come to him before pulling it over the fielder. Nehra under pressure",Nehra to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,11.4,"Henriques to Kedar Jadhav, out Kedar Jadhav Run Out!! 1 run completed. Cutting has conjured a wicket out of nowhere. That's a sensational throw from the deep. My goodness. He's absolutely nailed the stump from long leg and Jadhav is out of here. This is a huge moment in the context of the match, especially as Jadhav was looking so good. Even this shot which he played was extraordinary. It was a length ball outside off, Jadhav sat on his back knee and scooped it over short fine leg. He was a little slow to decide on the second run, maybe a little hesitant and boy did Cutting make him pay! More than a couple of feet short, even with a dive. Kedar Jadhav run out (Cutting) 31(16) [4s-4 6s-1]",Henriques to Kedar Jadhav,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,12.4,"Rashid Khan to Head, FOUR, goes down and smashes the full toss over the deep mid-wicket ropes. Some nerves maybe from the Afghanistan leggie and Head pounced all over them with a mighty slog-sweep",Rashid Khan to Head,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,12.5,"Rashid Khan to Head, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Rashid strikes back! That might have been the googly. Yeah, it seems so. Head went for another slog-sweep, but due to the variation, Rashid managed to generate some extra-bounce which took more of a thick top-edge and lobbed up towards long-on. It still came really close to clearing the boundary though. Yuvraj keeps his cool and takes it smartly. Head c Yuvraj b Rashid Khan 30(22) [4s-3]",Rashid Khan to Head,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,13.4,"Bipul Sharma to Sachin Baby, out Caught by Henriques!! Straight up off a leading edge, taken! SRH taking control. There's no turn on the ball as Bipul fires it on leg-stump from round the wicket, Baby swings across the line and is undone by the sliding delivery. Good catch from Henriques too. He pedalled backwards from mid-wicket and made it much easier than it should have been. Sachin Baby c Henriques b Bipul Sharma 1(3)",Bipul Sharma to Sachin Baby,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,15.0,"Rashid Khan to Watson, SIX, Rashid finishes with a long hop. To be fair, it's not abysmally short, but Watson is so good on the back foot. Rocks back quickly and hammers the pull over long-on",Rashid Khan to Watson,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,15.2,"Cutting to Binny, SIX, slower ball again but this time Binny hacks it over deep mid-wicket. It was slightly closer to off-stump and was given a fair tonk",Cutting to Binny,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,15.5,"Cutting to Watson, FOUR, plants his foot down and absolutely drills the ball wide of a diving extra-cover. Overpitched from Cutting, Watson blasts him away",Cutting to Watson,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,16.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Binny, 1 run, dropped! Naman Ojha, with the gloves on, puts one down. The ball went high up and was swirling awkwardly all the way through. But at this level, it should be taken. Binny was completely duped by the slower leg-cutter. Such good bowling from Bhuvi to keep it wide of off and out of reach",Bhuvneshwar to Binny,ONE
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,16.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Binny, out Caught by Yuvraj!! Gone this time. Yuvraj makes no mistake at backward point. What a top over this has been from Bhuvneshwar. It may now be a mountain too high for the RCB to climb. Binny backs away to slash a back of a length delivery over point. But this is a leg-cutter which bounces spongily and he slices it up to the fielder. Binny c Yuvraj b Bhuvneshwar 11(10) [6s-1]",Bhuvneshwar to Binny,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,17.3,"Nehra to Watson, out Caught by Henriques!! That's the end of Watson, and of RCB. The little bit of reverse-swing which Nehra uses to curl the ball away from Watson does his undoing. Despite it being another full toss, Watson slices it straight up off the outside half of his bat. Simple catch at extra-cover. Watson c Henriques b Nehra 22(17) [4s-1 6s-1]",Nehra to Watson,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,17.4,"Nehra to Aravind, out Bowled!! Terrific yorker from Nehra; a perfect way to seal wicket no. 100 in the IPL for the veteran pacer. The ball tails back in, zips through Aravind before his bat could come down and plants leg-stump into its grave. Nehra on a hat-trick. Aravind b Nehra 0(2)",Nehra to Aravind,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,18.4,"Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills, SIX, full and wide, Mills has a proper dash at it and he's flayed it away over the point boundary. Magnificent hit. Bhuvneshwar won't enjoy that",Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,18.5,"Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills, out Caught by Warner!! Good lord, that's got air miles on it. Way up into the night sky, Warner settles under it at long-on and takes it. Bhuvneshwar had slowed the pace down on the delivery, causing Mills to go through with the hoick too early. Right off the toe-end of the bat. Tymal Mills c Warner b Bhuvneshwar 6(3) [6s-1]",Bhuvneshwar to Tymal Mills,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,19.3,"Cutting to Aniket Choudhary, SIX, first ball Choudhary faces in the IPL, he smashes it over long leg. A short ball from Cutting, Choudhary swings into an instinctive pull and gets enough on it",Cutting to Aniket Choudhary,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,19.4,"Cutting to Aniket Choudhary, out Chahal Run Out!! Direct-hit and that's it! SRH with a comprehensive win in the IPL 10 opener. Another pull shot from Choudhary, this one's straight to mid-wicket. Chahal comes running down only to be sent back and he had given up. Jordan with the bull's eye. Chahal run out (Jordan) 3(7)",Cutting to Aniket Choudhary,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,2.2,"Nehra to Gayle, FOUR, Nehra goes back to the shorter length, Gayle seems a tad comfortable with that, hops on one leg and uses Nehra's pace to guide it past the diving short fine leg fielder",Nehra to Gayle,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,2.4,"Nehra to Mandeep, FOUR, might have been the slower one and Mandeep picked the bones out of that one. He cleared his front leg to give him more options and then slots the loft over mid-on, one bounce and over the rope",Nehra to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,3.0,"Nehra to Gayle, SIX, that ball hung in the night sky for eternity. Never looked like coming down. For what it's worth Gayle gets the maximum result. Length delivery right in the swinging zone and Gayle did not hold back, went full-monty and heaved it over deep mid-wicket. Six number one for Gayle in IPL 10",Nehra to Gayle,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,3.2,"Bhuvneshwar to Gayle, SIX, Gayle is in the mood. Mind you, he's not been in the best of forms, but IPL is his cup of tea. Bhuvneshwar dishes a full length delivery and hopes to get away with it, Gayle doesn't allow him to, carves it over long-on for his second maximum",Bhuvneshwar to Gayle,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,4.0,"Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep, FOUR, Mandeep is playing the perfect foil to Gayle. Warner already worried. Full on middle and leg, whipped through mid-wicket and mid-on. Hit uppishly but placed it expertly in the gap",Bhuvneshwar to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,5.0,"Cutting to Gayle, FOUR, not convincing, but Gayle will take that. A very good over from Cutting. Just misses the length this ball, goes full and that allows Gayle to get underneath and hoick it over mid-wicket. Not off the middle but enough to clear the fielder",Cutting to Gayle,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,5.2,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, FOUR, Rashid throws it up once more and this time Mandeep threads the crowded off-side field. Overpitched and Mandeep went full-throttle on the drive, raced to the sweeper fence",Rashid Khan to Mandeep,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,5.4,"Rashid Khan to Mandeep, out Bowled!! He strikes! The customary celebration follows. One hand up and the finger pointing skywards. The most delighted man in the dugout was his fellow countryman - Mohammad Nabi. He too had his finger up in celebration. The quicker wrong 'un and Mandeep clearly did not pick it, went back for the cut and gets cramped for room, only manages a chop onto the stumps. Mandeep b Rashid Khan 24(16) [4s-5]",Rashid Khan to Mandeep,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,6.2,"Deepak Hooda to Gayle, SIX, a gift from Hooda and Gayle thumps it over the rope. A full toss outside off, Gayle takes a step out and slots it straight back over the bowler's head. Went miles back into the crowd",Deepak Hooda to Gayle,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,6.3,"Deepak Hooda to Gayle, out Caught by Warner!! It was an experiment from Warner and it has paid off. Completes the catch, turns towards the crowd and does a fist pump. RCB have lost two in quick succession. Both set batsmen gone. Slows it up as Gayle gives the charge, he goes through with the loft even though he isn't to pitch of the ball, miscues it towards long-off and Warner ain't dropping those. Gayle c Warner b Deepak Hooda 32(21) [4s-2 6s-3]",Deepak Hooda to Gayle,OUT
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,7.1,"Rashid Khan to Head, FOUR, lots of flighted and lands as a half volley, Head gets a good stride forward and drives it past Henriques at extra cover, the timing was superb as long-off had no chance of cutting that off",Rashid Khan to Head,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,8.0,"Rashid Khan to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, ordinary delivery from Rashid and Jadhav is all over it. The young man is shaking his head while taking his cap from the umpire. Half tracker which sat up nicely for Jadhav, who pulls it between deep mid-wicket and long-on",Rashid Khan to Kedar Jadhav,FOUR
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,8.5,"Cutting to Kedar Jadhav, SIX, that looked like a half-hearted shot from Jadhav and it has travelled the distance. Picked the back of a length delivery and pulled it to the vacant deep mid-wicket region, just cleared the rope",Cutting to Kedar Jadhav,SIX
4281444,RCB 1st Inns,9.1,"Henriques to Head, FOUR, Head does the most of the full length delivery, stays deep in the crease and opens himself up to free his arms, smashes it straight down the ground and even a quick Warner could not reach that from long-on",Henriques to Head,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,0.3,"Tymal Mills to Warner, FOUR, lovely shot, sublime timing on that one from Warner, it wasn't anything more than a back-foot punch. This was a back of a length delivery outside off, he got on top of the bounce and placed it in the gap past point",Tymal Mills to Warner,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,1.2,"Aniket Choudhary to Warner, FOUR, smashed, width on offer from Choudhary, Warner gets forward and thumps it over mid-off, couple of bounces and over the ropes",Aniket Choudhary to Warner,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,1.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Warner, SIX, .. and Warner makes the most of the free-hit. Another pretty poor ball from Choudhary, short and just outside off, Warner rocks back and pulls it high and over mid-wicket, went sailing into the stands for the first six of IPL 10",Aniket Choudhary to Warner,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,1.4,"Aniket Choudhary to Warner, out Caught by Mandeep!! The night has changed completely for the 27-year old RCB debutant. Warner has been dismissed for less than fifty for the first time against RCB - when he's playing for SRH. On a good length and well outside off, it was there to be smacked, Warner didn't go through with the shot completely, he was just looking to clear the infield. Mandeep times his jump to perfection at point and completes a good two-handed catch. Warner c Mandeep b Aniket Choudhary 14(8) [4s-2 6s-1]",Aniket Choudhary to Warner,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,10.2,"Binny to Dhawan, FOUR, oh boy. He's toying around with the bowling out here. Binny looks to go wide outside off with the shortened length as well. But Dhawan in all his confidence walks across, crouches and half-pulls, half-sweeps it past the reach of the man at 45-degrees behind square",Binny to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,10.3,"Binny to Dhawan, out Caught by Sachin Baby!! This was coming. It really was. Tactical aggression here from SD with his dance down the track looking to smoke some into the clouds. Does everything in getting right to the pitch of this fuller one as well, swings mighty too, just that he skews it off the toe end. All the altitude and into the safe palms of Baby at long-on. Dhawan c Sachin Baby b Binny 40(31) [4s-5]",Binny to Dhawan,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,11.5,"Aravind to Yuvraj, FOUR, here's the pick up. Vintage Yuvraj. Helped by an allying half volley on the pads at gentle pace and all he does with it is lovingly lofts his flick. All the timing and a bounce into the mid-wicket fence",Aravind to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,12.1,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, FOUR, streaky. But the runs keeps leaking. Does it really matter how. Wide, half way down the track and Yuvraj anticipates the ball to fizz up in flat batting it across. There's barely any climb, and all he gets is the inside edge to impart the direction in guiding it just past the sticks",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,12.2,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, SIX, whoa. This is getting back in the 2007 zone. Choudhary without a clue as to where to bowl goes full and wide. The mind-reader gets the front leg out and unleashes a full bat swing showing the maker's name in tonking it right on the extra cover ropes",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,12.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, FOUR, and it keeps getting better. Rocks back, stands tall, waits for the short drag down to sit up and swats in his swivel. All the crunch in the timing to reintroduce it back into the fence",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,13.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, 1 run, oh Aravind. You really do not grant a life. Certainly not to this guy. Another compulsive pull here from Yuvraj but with the ball gaining in height, only manages the top-edge. Right into the hands of fine leg, who slides and makes an absolute mess",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,ONE
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,13.1,"Watson to Yuvraj, FOUR, back to the usual. Is this a surprise anymore. This time the skipper decides to test him with a short one, one that neither has the pace nor the bounce. And obliged with a swat. As flat as you'd want",Watson to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,14.1,"Aravind to Henriques, FOUR, on the charge. And the slap. The combo bags yet another fence hunter. Walks down, intercepts the length and gets on top of the bounce of this back of a length delivery in flaying it in front of square",Aravind to Henriques,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,14.3,"Aravind to Yuvraj, SIX, into the first tier. And a standing admire from Yuvraj. Aravind serves a pie with the short sitter and heaved away. So very typical. Equally friendly bowling here as well",Aravind to Yuvraj,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,14.5,"Aravind to Henriques, SIX, now Henriques joins the act. Wants to ive his partner a run for his money. A run for some crowd catchers. Keeps banging it in short with the pitch sucking away all the momentum. Another mow across to give the crowd some work. Brings up his fifty. In some style",Aravind to Henriques,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,15.2,"Chahal to Henriques, out Caught by Sachin Baby!! Some normalcy restored. And as always is the case, it is spin that gets on that duty. Chahal doesn't mind giving it some air inviting the big swing. And gets just that. A full-blooded tonk down and skewed away. Almost teases Baby at the long-off fence with this one threatening to fly over, before the bucket hands facing upwards come to the rescue in plucking it out. They're checking the foot's behaviour - just inside the permissable limits. Henriques c Sachin Baby b Chahal 52(37) [4s-3 6s-2]",Chahal to Henriques,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,15.5,"Chahal to Yuvraj, 1 run, is that a bird? Is that a plane? Oh it is Mandeep Singh on his flying ways. Yuvraj goes through with yet another ones of his delightful airy drives. Is in the process of admiration just as Mandy runs across at the long-off fence, leaps and pulls it back into the field of play. Almost plucked it out while landing down too. Oof",Chahal to Yuvraj,ONE
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,16.3,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, FOUR, head on. The battle continues. With Mills keen on cramping him up with the short pepper gets it barely up to the ribs. Just when he spots the bat going flat and the face pointing upwards in hooking it away. Behind square it flies",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,17.1,"Aniket Choudhary to Deepak Hooda, SIX, the march to the double ton gets another gear. And some help from Chahal in tipping it over the fence. Hooda opens up and uses his entire height to good effect in his tall pull. Mid-wicket takes another one in its kitty",Aniket Choudhary to Deepak Hooda,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,17.3,"Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj, FOUR, a salute in celebration. Takes the bat to his head in holding it up to his team mates inside. Covers all his sticks with a shuffle and after getting bored of the wides throws the kitchen sink at it and slaps it over point. #HisFastestIPLFifty",Aniket Choudhary to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,18.2,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, FOUR, full, down leg. Nothing right with that. Certainly not if fine leg is inside. Certainly not if that man is Chris Gayle. All Yuvraj has to do is get the bat down in giving it some tickle. And places it wide and into the ropes",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,18.3,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, SIX, the murder continues. Mass murder. Another spirit buries itself inside this pitch. Overcompensates going short, going quick but the response is quicker. Is brutal too. Back to his high backlifted pulls. Gravity too cannot pull it down",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,18.4,"Tymal Mills to Yuvraj, out Bowled!! The zings light up. The crowd refuses to believe and keep searching for the ball. Nope, that's the end of the fun in store folks. Mills for a change aims for the stumps, going slower as well. Nicely off the back of the hand and foxes him with the seam position. A swat across the line is missed eventually and the top of leg takes the brunt. This has been some serious clock roll back here. Makes me feel 10 years younger. Yuvraj b Tymal Mills 62(27) [4s-7 6s-3]",Tymal Mills to Yuvraj,OUT
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,19.3,"Watson to Cutting, SIX, the yorkers too cannot stop the bleeding. Cutting rocks way inside, crouches, gets underneath the supposed yorker and carries on from the finals a year ago in tonking the drive",Watson to Cutting,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,2.0,"Aniket Choudhary to Henriques, FOUR, eventful first over from Choudhary, a wicket and 16 runs. Another freebie to end his over, short and wide outside off, Henriques was all over it as he cracked it square past point, beats the inner ring and rolls away to the fence",Aniket Choudhary to Henriques,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,20.0,"Watson to Cutting, SIX, a dramatic photo finish. Watson tries another short one but this time Cutting ain't surprised. Stands up, uses his entire height to good effect and smokes it away. Admiring it as he does so. As flat as the bat motion could get",Watson to Cutting,SIX
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,3.5,"Chahal to Henriques, 1 run, a direct hit at the bowler's end and Henriques was struggling. He was coming back for the second run, Dhawan didn't respond one bit. Aravind was the man with the throw and he sent it to the keeper. Kedar Jadhav still had time to effect the run-out, but his shy is way off-target. Henriques scrambles home with a dive. Coming to the ball, it was flat and wide of off, punched to the left of long-off",Chahal to Henriques,ONE
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,4.5,"Aravind to Henriques, FOUR, too short from Aravind, can't bowl those at his pace. Henriques swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Aravind to Henriques,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.1,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, gentle loosener from Watson, short and on Dhawan's hips, he swivels across, uses the pace on the ball and helps it behind square on the on-side for a boundary",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.2,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, lovely shot, Dhawan is getting into his groove now. Comes down the track, doesn't get close to the ball, that allows him to free his arms and drill it back past the umpire, no need to run for those",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.4,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, juicy full-toss and Dhawan has put it away, turning out to be an expensive start from Watson. Dhawan leans into the shot and finds the gap wide of mid-off, no need to run for those",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,5.5,"Watson to Dhawan, FOUR, make that four fours of the over, banged in short and on the stumps, Dhawan swivels across, rolls his wrists and pulls it behind square on the on-side. Watson was expensive in the final of IPL 2016, he has started badly here once again",Watson to Dhawan,FOUR
4281444,SRH 1st Inns,7.4,"Head to Henriques, SIX, massive, Henriques shimmies down the track, makes room as he did so and goes high and over long-on, went a long way into the stands. Watches in admiration as the ball kept going and going",Head to Henriques,SIX

7898444,MI 1st Inns,1.1,"Chahar to Buttler, FOUR, length ball outside off and Buttler is away. Swats it across the line and gets it wide of mid-on",Chahar to Buttler,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,1.3,"Chahar to Buttler, FOUR, shuffles across and flicks a ball from middle stump, easily done. With fine leg inside the ring that was always asking for trouble, Buttler obliged",Chahar to Buttler,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,10.5,"Zampa to Nitish Rana, FOUR, Zampa not getting the googly right. Again down leg and this time Rana gets a bit of bat/glove on that. The ball races away fine beating the short fine fielder",Zampa to Nitish Rana,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,11.1,"R Bhatia to Rayudu, out Caught&Bowled!! Thank You! A typical Bhatia wicket. Foxes the batsman with a 116kph delivery and Rayudu is found checking his drive, spoons a straightforward chance and Bhatia accepts the dolly.

7898444,MI 1st Inns,12.1,"Stokes to Nitish Rana, SIX, Stokes would be proud of that shot. Banged in halfway down and the line was around off, Rana is quick to transfer his weight onto the back foot and nails the pull over deep square leg. Third six that Stokes has conceded",Stokes to Nitish Rana,SIX
7898444,MI 1st Inns,13.2,"R Bhatia to Krunal Pandya, out Caught by Dhoni!! First Tahir and now Bhatia. The slow bowlers are doing it for RPS. Bhatia lets out a roar as soon as MS completes the catch. He's been exceptional with his variations. This offie was bowled at 96kph, Pandya just didn't have the pace to slog it across the line, the top-edge skies up and Dhoni calls for it. Takes it in his own unique way, one leg up in the air. Krunal Pandya c Dhoni b R Bhatia 3(5)",R Bhatia to Krunal Pandya,OUT
7898444,MI 1st Inns,14.1,"Tahir to Pollard, FOUR, Pollard welcomes him with a thumping drive. Bit of air and Pollard plants his front foot forward, smashed it straight back over the bowler's head. Didn't bother to run, he knew he had middled it",Tahir to Pollard,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,15.1,"Zampa to Pollard, FOUR, Pollard goes downtown once more and gets the desired result. Zampa goes fuller with the tossed up delivery and Pollard drills it straight back at Zampa, who is slow to get down and stop it",Zampa to Pollard,FOUR
7898444,MI 1st Inns,15.3,"Zampa to Nitish Rana, out Caught by R Bhatia!! Bhatia has made amends. Put a sitter down early in the innings, this time keeps his eyes on the ball and ends Rana's knock. It was the googly which was drifting away from the southpaw, Rana went down and slog swept it flat, Bhatia didn't have to move at deep mid-wicket to pouch that.

""That's an absolute shocker,"" says KP on air and he's right. Massive inside edge onto the pad. Two poor decisions in two overs might have just cost MI the game. The off-break which turns back in and cramps Rohit for room, he hurriedly brings his bat down and smashes it into his pads. The umpire didn't spot it and gave it out after a thought. Rohit was fuming after the decision. Even showed his bat to the umpire gesturing he hit it. But you can't overturn an onfield decision unless you have the DRS and that is not available in the IPL.

It is yet another start for the Englishman that is not converted. It's always dangerous to shimmy down the wicket for a bowler like Tahir, who generally skids the ball through, and that is what happened. Billings came down the wicket and Tahir pushed it through, by the time the Kent batsman could get his bat down, the ball was past him and crashed into off-stump.

Even his favourite helicopter shot has gone wrong tonight, that should snuff out whatever little hopes Pune might have had. This was tossed up invitingly by Mishra, Dhoni cleared his left leg and whipped it off his toes - flat and hard, but straight to Karun Nair at deep mid-wicket.

Fair call, looked like the ball might just have touched the ground as Karun plucked it.

It was on a fuller length around off, it was the off-cutter from Zak. Rahane perhaps went hard at it, the ball seemed to have stopped on the pitch and that must've foiled Rahane's attempt there.

Can tonight be the night?",Sandeep Sharma to Buttler,SIX

He's almost taken Pune home here",Faulkner to Stokes,FOUR

Called for the second run and then stops mid-way to spoil things for himself because Stokes had committed for the run. Stokes thuds this on-drive down the ground towards long-on. Finch has some distance to cover and Tripathi senses the second run. Withdraws late and digs his grave as Finch hits the target at the bowler's end. Stokes looked angry there. No fault of his though.

The SRH captain didn't look comfortable at all and DD will be delighted with that wicket.

He can't believe it - for a moment, long-off thought it was an easy chance, but he kept watching it soar over his head.

Relief on the faces of the Daredevils fielders, this was short and on the stumps - asking to be smacked.

Having not given anything by way of flight all through the over, he tosses up a googly and dangles it wide of off to reap the pay-off for his pressure.

1922365,KXIP 1st Inns,15.1,"Zampa to Ishant, out Caught by Smith!! All too easy. All too familiar. The tried and tested ploy to a tail-ender and for the umpteenth time in history, it pays off. Zampa lets out one of the floatiest of leg-breaks tossing it very wide outside the sticks. Ishant sinks on a knee, slogs it big time. It grows big on him, takes the outside half of the bat and all it finds is cover. Ishant c Smith b Zampa 1(5)",Zampa to Ishant,OUT
1922365,KXIP 1st Inns,15.5,"Zampa to Mohit Sharma, out Caught by Christian!! That's curtains. Mohit doesn't believe in knocking the ball around and playing out his quota of overs. Apparently.

1922365,KXIP 1st Inns,3.3,"SN Thakur to Shaun Marsh, out Caught by Smith!! That's a dolly and Smith has gobbled up his Australian teammate. On a good length and angling across the left-hander, Shardul bowled this one with a scrambled seam. The ball once again looked like it stopped on the batsman - Marsh was committed on the drive, couldn't keep it down, went off the splice of the bat and spoons a simple catch to Smith at mid-off.

KXIP are in doldrums now and the move to promote Tewatia up the order has failed. This was banged in short and on his body, Tewatia was late on the pull, the ball ballooned off the top-edge and lobbed behind the keeper. On another day it could have dropped down in no man's land - but not today. Unadkat moves across to his left, goes with both hands and completes a fine diving catch.

Vinay Kumar conceded 14 runs in the previous match off the first over, concedes two extra in this one.

Clever bowling from Chawla, slowed it up a touch and kept it outside off, Dhoni was down on his knee to play the sweep, through the shot early and the under edge is found.

Must have expected de Villiers to go for it after just four came off the last ten balls. And it works. de Villiers wants to go in-to-out, but the spin away forces the miscue, and they have one of the best fielders in the team in Billings at deep cover, running in to settle under that.

Misses it completely and the woodwork is disturbed. Nevertheless, a top quality innings from the young man. He's made a statement here in the IPL.

Lovely bouncer and Pant was stuck on the crease, probably beaten for both pace and bounce. Fails to drop his wrists in time and it flies high off the glove. It's a dolly for the KKR skipper and suddenly, the visitors are right back in this with the twin strikes. The in-form Pant has to go. He has a wry smile on his face as he walks back.

Banged in short by Boult and Dhoni was down the track in a flash, flat-batted it powerfully past the Kiwi who did well to get out of the way. Rockets past mid-off who was in the ring. Incredible, simply incredible",Boult to Dhoni,FOUR
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,19.5,"Boult to Dhoni, out Rayudu Run Out!! That's the end of Rayudu, wanted to get on strike as Dhoni had missed the pull but the CSK captain remained unmoved. Pant was quick to throw it towards Boult who fired a direct hit at the other end. Rayudu was way short and was never going to make it. Another valuable contribution from him nevertheless.

5715249,CSK 1st Inns,4.3,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX, short ball, journey ball! That has gone into the stands. The batsman does not bother to go on the back foot and pulls it off the front foot. That was a bad bad delivery and the deep square leg region was peppered with the sinews working in tandem",Plunkett to Watson,SIX
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,4.4,"Plunkett to Watson, SIX, pick up off the pads. And the spectators pick it in the stands.

5715249,CSK 1st Inns,5.2,"Avesh Khan to Watson, SIX, top-edge! Six! Gosh! Over long-on. That was unbelieveable. The short ball, the batsman seemed to be slightly late on it and the ball flew away over long-on fence. Incredible",Avesh Khan to Watson,SIX
5715249,CSK 1st Inns,6.0,"Avesh Khan to du Plessis, FOUR, short ball at the body. Again skidded through and the batsman under-edges the ball away fine on the on-side for a four.

Told you, Asif can hoodwink the batsmen with his skiddy short balls, here's the evidence. A short of length that kicks onto Shaw, he looked for a cross-batted smash across the line. Is hurried by the pace and ends up slicing it towards mid-on. Jaddu, the best fielder in the CSK set-up leaps across, times his jump to perfection and pouches the dolly at mid-off.

He was almost beaten by the change of pace by this shortish slower ball, slapped it pretty straight towards long-on despite having to fetch this from outside off stump. Dhoni has been having long-on very wide fro Pant and he had no chance. In fact, Dhoni and Bravo were not happy with Faf.

Second wicket for Asif, nips out both openers. Looked like it was a certain trap, plotted by MSD and Asif. Much like the last ball, ushered it short and this was closer to the body. Munro swung across, only height as it went a long way into the night sky. There was a fielder waiting at deep mid-wicket and he set himself under it to gobble it up. Safe hands from Karn Sharma.

Push-driven towards extra cover, there was never a single there. Iyer kept running, Pant took a couple of strides down the pitch before he stopped.

Polly won't drop that. Kohli is shocked to say the least, makes his emotions known before trudging off. That's a difference of at least 20 in my book. Now Hardik Pandya suddenly is on a hat-trick.

Flighted teasingly from Mishra, Kishan took the bait -- had to because he was struggling a bit. Meets the pitch in a hurry and smashed it flat towards long-on.

Made room to a slider from Tahir, ended up getting too close for comfort as it zips through and crashes his front pad first.

Tough catch because the ball almost shaved the off stump as well. Oh they are checking for the no-ball, Raina blocks the side angle from deep cover, but the other angle shows a very minute portion of the heel to be behind the crease when Jadeja landed.

Just runs out of patience and goes hard on the whippy flick, hits it airly and finds Bhajji at short mid-wicket, who takes a sharp catch.

2331682,KKR 1st Inns,1.3,"Chris Morris to Uthappa, FOUR, lovely, too straight from Morris, he hasn't hit his stride as yet - Uthappa gets inside the line and clips it neatly through mid-wicket, no need to run for those",Chris Morris to Uthappa,FOUR
2331682,KKR 1st Inns,11.3,"Axar to Shubman Gill, SIX, superb shot! Much-needed for KKR. Probably the first one that Axar floated ever so slightly and Gill was down the pitch in a flash. Lofted through the line and send it soaring down the ground. Clears the ropes with ease",Axar to Shubman Gill,SIX
2331682,KKR 1st Inns,12.1,"Chris Morris to Shubman Gill, 1 run, 2nd IPL fifty for Gill! First innings as an opener and he's grabbed the opportunity.

Reaches the landmark with a slice down to third man",Chris Morris to Shubman Gill,ONE
2331682,KKR 1st Inns,12.3,"Chris Morris to Nitish Rana, SIX, just clears Dhawan! For a moment, he was certainly excited but it just about cleared him.

2331682,KKR 1st Inns,12.4,"Chris Morris to Nitish Rana, out Bowled!! Yorks him! Brilliant riposte from Morris. Nails the yorker with perfection and Rana who was backing away to make room, had to get his bat down in time. Couldn't due to the pace and precision of the delivery. Timber.

2331682,KKR 1st Inns,14.2,"K Paul to Shubman Gill, out Caught by Axar!! What an anti-climax for Gill! For someone who batted with so much authority, he's got out to a poor delivery, a scoring delivery. Was fed down the leg-side and he went for an aerial flick. Just had to beat short fine leg to get another boundary but picks out Axar stationed in the ring. Soft dismissal and Gill knows it. Superb innings nevertheless from the young man.

Pacy full ball on the pads and Karthik goes that favorite aerial flick of his. Only that this time, there is a deep square leg in place for such kind of an adventure.

2331682,KKR 1st Inns,18.2,"Chris Morris to A Russell, out Caught by Rabada!! Massive wicket! Good planning from DC for this wicket. Morris went round the wicket and wanted to execute the wide yorker from that angle. Didn't get it fully right and was a low full toss but induced the slice from Russell who didn't get the desired connection. It's flat and towards deep backward point where Rabada accepts it with glee. This wicket will definitely make a difference of 15-20 runs to the eventual total and DC know it.

Rightly played second fiddle to Russell earlier although he could have tried at least one big shot. Now, in an attempt to up the ante, doesn't get the placement right on the slog.

2331682,KKR 1st Inns,2.3,"Ishant to Shubman Gill, 1 run, a direct hit might have been interesting - Shubman pushed this one in front of mid-on and called for a quick single - it was always a dicey single - Shreyas was quick on the ball and has a shy - had he hit, Shubman would have been short, despite the dive",Ishant to Shubman Gill,ONE
2331682,KKR 1st Inns,3.0,"Ishant to Shubman Gill, FOUR, cracking shot, fraction too short from Ishant, Shubman stands tall and pulls it in front of square on the on-side - beat mid-wicket and raced away across the fast outfield",Ishant to Shubman Gill,FOUR

2331682,KKR 1st Inns,8.4,"Rabada to Uthappa, out Caught by Pant!! That's a top catch from Pant and Rabada has got his man - followed the slower yorker with a fiery bouncer - short and angling down the leg-side, Uthappa was looking to help it on its way - all that he managed was a glove.

He never got going today though, seemed scratchy and even disinterested a bit. Had to launch now with enough batting in the shed and opts for the muscular slog of his. The length isn't there and the result is a miscue that goes miles in the air. Brilliant catch from Gopal who steadied himself nicely at mid-wicket to take it with a tumble.

But that's the hallmark of a superb fielder, made it look like regulation stuff. Ends a fine knock from de Kock who was visibly jaded. Went for the loft but was undone by the slower ball this time.

KKR needed this desperately to have any hope of getting back. And they're surely back in it now.

8556956,RCB 1st Inns,8.3,"Hardik Pandya to de Villiers, FOUR, french-cut from de Villiers and it almost shaved the off-stump. Nervy times for the South African these. This good length delivery nipped in a bit and de Villiers was cramped for room as he went for the cut - too close for comfort.

Probably, Archer - the fielder - was standing a few yards inside the rope, had he been near the boundary, he would've had a better chance of catching it. Big misjudgement from him there as Gayle gets away. It was banged in short, Gayle after a few sighters takes it on and pulls.

Couldn't free his arms properly and ended up skewing the loft high into the night skies at deep mid-wicket. Not easy, these high catches but Buttler is a pro in the outfield.

As KXIP were about to review, the umpire raised his finger but Saha didn't probably see that. He was standing with Warner, which made it seem like he wanted the review.

That's enough for the third umpire to overturn the original call. Warner is OUT. Think it's a fair decision from the third umpire, Chris Gaffaney.

5937426,RR 1st Inns,4.0,"Rabada to Smith, FOUR, who'd've thought the world's best Test batsman would out-unorthodox a Maxi?

5937426,RR 1st Inns,8.1,"Nortje to Smith, out Caught by Hetmyer! That's a fabulous low catch! Umpire review - soft signal is out. He's played another one of his effortless flicks, uppishly this time, and Hetmyer has been quick in runnign in from the cow corner boundary to pick up a fantastic low catch!
